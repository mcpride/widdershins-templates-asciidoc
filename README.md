# Convert OpenAPI 3 definitions to ASCIIDOC documentation with widdershins

## Information

This repository contains the [widdershins](https://github.com/Mermade/widdershins/) [openapi3 templates](https://github.com/Mermade/widdershins/tree/main/templates/openapi3) of version 4.01 - modified, to produce a valid single [ASCIIDOC](https://asciidoc.org/) document, which can be included into other docs and converted to diverse target formats. 

Unfortunately the conversion rate is not 100%! For example markdown in descriptions will not be properly converted, but it helps me and my team to produce valid human readable interface documentation.

There is a petstore 3 example included to check the results.

Feel free to use it ... but without guarantees ;-)
